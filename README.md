# Introduction to Selenium

#### This is a project-based learning repo for Selenium. The teacher is Tim from techwithtim on YouTube.

1. This repo contains mulitple .py files that illustrate using Selenium in various ways. Every file starts with a comment section that contains what the file is about and what it does.

2. The repo also contains a folder called unit_test that is how a test on a website is carried out in the industry using Selenium. It involves quite a lot of advanced Python concepts that require you to go through the entirety of the code thoroughly.

#### Personal Note: While referring, don't jump to the unit_test dir, understand the solo files and then proceed.
